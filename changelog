Overview of Project

Use TKinter GUI to ask the user for the following:
    * executable file
    * folder with input files
    * extension of input files
    * folder for output files
    * extension for output files

Once user confirms, the following will need to happen:
    1) Check all fields have been filled
    2) Determine what operating system is hosting the app
    3) Loop through the folder with input files
        * if a file with correct extension:
            * send command to shell with redirection
            * format of command will depend on OS
            * Check if command executed successfully
                * if infinite loop, terminate that process
                  and print it took too long


* Maybe make the log not clear automatically on run?
    * would add a manual clear button then
* Could make the GUI look cleaner
    * for now, as long as it works I'm happy
